React isomorphic bootstrap

Simple isomorphic boostrap project

I followed a tutorial online at https://24ways.org/2015/universal-react/
and I wanted to re-create their project from scratch for my own personal knowledge.

Here's what included:

1. ejs: templating engine to render HTML on the server
2. express: small web framework to run the server
3. react-router: routing solution for React
4. react-dom: library for rendering React components

Others:
EMCAScript 6, BabelJS

Build process:
Webpack, babel-loader
